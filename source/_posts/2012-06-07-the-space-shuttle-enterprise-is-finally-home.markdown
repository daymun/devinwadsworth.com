I got some cool shots of the space shuttle coming into Pier 86 yesterday afternoon. It's now safely resting at its new home, the [Intrepid Museum](http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/), with [barely a scratch](http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-060412a.html). Check out the [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/devinwadsworth/sets/72157630011346391).
