I was tired of having thousands of photos in my Dropbox camera uploads, so I wrote a simple [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/photobox) to organize photos into folders.

{% img /images/photobox-unclustered.png Unclustered %}
{% img /images/arrow-right.png Right arrow %}
{% img /images/photobox-clustered.png Clustered %}

The [gem source](https://github.com/daymun/photobox) is available on GitHub.
