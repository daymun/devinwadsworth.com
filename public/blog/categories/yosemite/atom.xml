    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Switching to a new development machine is often a great opportunity to start fresh and explore new tools. That said, there&rsquo;s a core set of applications and associated preferences that I always take with me.</p>

<p>I appreciate the philosophy of sensible defaults found in Rails and similar frameworks. Context switching between multiple codebases is made easier through the widely accepted &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; that are codified in the underlying framework.</p>

<p>Sensible defaults guide you in the right direction; doing things the hard way can sometimes be avoided by embracing defaults. When the need to change a default setting presents itself, often the best solution is to change approach to better utilize the capabilities of the framework, thereby avoiding another re-invented wheel. Of course, sometimes you really do need to change settings. If the use case is wide enough to warrant it, a new default will hopefully be adopted in a future release of the framework.</p>

<p>I see similar benefits to embracing sensible defaults in the OS. Because of Apple&rsquo;s prevalence within the developer community, many development workstations already work similarly. When I set up a new Macbook I don&rsquo;t use migration assistant. Instead, I document where I&rsquo;ve deviated from the system defaults on my old computer and apply those changes on the new machine. I migrate application level preferences with <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">Mackup</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve documented my approach to setting up OS X environments for development the from the last time I switched MacBooks a few months ago: <a href="https://github.com/daymun/firstboot">github.com/daymun/firstboot</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to fork firstboot and customize it to your liking. Please send a pull request if you discover a default that&rsquo;s not sensible!</p>
